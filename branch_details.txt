main.py (driver code)
packages (individual features that will be developed later on)

I will not put detector and classifier model online as it is network heavy(for me)
I will provide the links for them

classifier:
  >https://github.com/bedapudi6788/NudeNet-models/blob/master/v1/classifier_model

detector:
  >https://github.com/bedapudi6788/NudeNet-models/blob/master/v1/detector_model

  dependencies:

  >moviepy (pip install moviepy)
  >opencv (follow thier documentation)
  >tensorflow (follow their documentation)
  >NudeNet (pip install nudenet)
  >github (for version control obviously)
